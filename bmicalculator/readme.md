Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/jKHjnLrNQjqzdz3MTMyv

Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

Example Input
weight = 80
height = 1.75
Example Output
80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

26

Hint
Check the data type of the inputs.
Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
Remember PEMDAS.
Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).



Under 18.5 they are underweight
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Above 35 they are clinically obese.

"Your BMI is 18, you are underweight."
"Your BMI is 22, you have a normal weight."
"Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight."
"Your BMI is 33, you are obese."
"Your BMI is 40, you are clinically obese."
